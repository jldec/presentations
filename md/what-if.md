## What if...

## What if you had an editor

## An app you use to write stuff

## And it saves the stuff you write in a file

## Just ONE file<br>With 1 or 2, or lots of pages in it

## Sound familiar?

## Word ?

## Pages ?

## It's 2015

## People should be able read<br> what you write<br> online

## hmmm, HTML?

## Yes!

## So where's this editor?
- umm
- here with HP [google](www.google.com)

## And that content you just updated

## that was in a text file?

## Yes, a source file (think github)
- like this
- with HP at coffee shop

## The pub format

    ---- /page1 ----
    data: text value

    # markdown markdown markdown markdown

    ---- /page2 ----

    # more markdown

## And this editor tool turns *that*<br>into HTML

## SO, who crafts the HTML and CSS?

## Designers

## How?

## Well

## HTML and CSS are text file formats

## So...

## They use another editor

## And how do the HTML and CSS<br>get from the designer<br>to **my** content editor?

## Packages

## WTF are Packages?

## Ask Isaac
