# Simple user management with oauth and ACLs

# simple user management
with oauth and acls

# The problem
- corporate website generated from content stored in markdown
- most of the time the templates and code are not being modified
- so non-designer/developer users should be able to maintain the site
- online (without installing anything)

# gmail
- everyone has a gmail address
- for many small companies gmail provides primary infrastructure
- with good support for managing users
- e.g. adding new users, revoking accounts when employees move on etc.

# UX of using gmail accounts for authentication
- point browser to pub-server URL

- if you're not already logged into gmail in this browser session

- now the server knows who the user is for this session
