# what is j building?
- an editor for non-technical users to write and publish in HTML, CSS etc. (it's about time)
- using templates created by designers, distributed as packages
- and a user experience which is more like word than like wordpress

# what's different about it
- content is stored in markdown fragments in human-readable text files
- you get all the power of github versioning if you want it
- you don't need to know html or css to use it
- but you can use the work of designers and developers
