## code wins
- this term is used in the context of software project management
- it usually means that working code wins over planning
- or, as at facebook, [code wins over arguments][1]

## but, there's another meaning to "code wins"

## background
![](/images/office.jpg "height=350 align=right")
- we were discussing the idea of using github for consultants
- and encountered the objection (not unfounded)
- that consultants are used to working in the *language* of office
- as in **microsoft office**

If and until we figure out how to easily translate
from the consulting language (Microsoft Office)
to Git, we wonâ€™t have the elegant version control
and forking of GH
```

## elevator pitch: before
- tools which enable people to publish on the web
- without giving up control of their content
- think "office for the web"

## elevator pitch: now
- enabling people to use the tools **of** the web, like github
- to publish and collaborate online

## which means
- we will bring the awesome world of software tools to office users
- rather than trying to be "office for the web" with convenient software tools as a feature

## starting with: "publishing from source"

## what is "source"?
- **source** is short for **source code**
- it comes from the days when people built software with compilers
  which turned "source" code into "object" code
- nowadays, it's more or less synonymous with **text files**

## what is "publishing from source"?
- you know that websites are written in HTML
- and HTML lives in text files
- so if you write HTML and put it on a website, you're *publishing from source*

## but HTML is for web developers
- normal humans should not have to write HTML
- but if the grammar is simple enough... it doesn't have to look like code
- normal humans can write source like,
  [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)
  ([guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- and with a little bit of help from the right tools...
- that can be compiled into something that other humans can read
- ergo *publishing from source*

## if you don't believe me
- Try editing the file [here](/pub/)

## so what?
- source enables github-like collaboration and version control
- source lets you publish the same content to different media or devices
- source enables new [body plans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_plan)
  for new kinds of content, published in new ways

## in other words...

## source code wins!
